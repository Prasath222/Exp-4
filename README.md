Step 1: Problem Identification
Manual hospital record handling causes delays and errors in patient care. The system aims to automate patient registration, appointment scheduling, billing, and report management.

Step 2: Requirement Analysis
Users: Admin, Doctor, Nurse, Receptionist, and Patient.
Main Functions: Patient registration, appointment booking, doctor management, billing, medical report handling, and discharge summary.
Non-Functional Needs: Security of patient data, reliability, and easy access.

Step 3: System Design
Create UML diagrams: Use Case, Class, Activity, Sequence, Communication, and Package diagrams.
Design database tables for Patients, Doctors, Appointments, Bills, and Reports.
